# Pytrends-SelmonBhai

The "Salman Khan Popularity" project is a data analysis project that uses Pytrends to track the popularity of Bollywood actor Salman Khan over the past few years. The project gathered data on Salman Khan's online search popularity and found that it increased by X% from Year 1 to Year 2 and by Y% from Year 2 to Year 3. The data was then visualized in a graph to clearly show the trend of Salman Khan's popularity over time. This project provides a quantitative insight into the popularity of Salman Khan and can be used for comparative analysis with other celebrities and trends. The use of Pytrends in this project demonstrates its effectiveness for data analysis and visualization with quantifiable results.
